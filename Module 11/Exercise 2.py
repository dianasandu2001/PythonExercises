#Extend the previosly written Car class by adding two subclasses: ElectricCar and GasolineCar. Electric cars have the
# capacity of the battery in kilowatt-hours as their property. Gasoline cars have the volume of the tank in liters as
# their property. Write initializers for the subclasses. For example, the initializer of electric cars receives the
# registration number, maximum speed and battery capacity as its parameter. It calls the initializer of the base class
# to set the first two properties and then sets its capacity. Write a main program where you create one electric car
# (ABC-15, 180 km/h, 52.5 kWh) and one gasoline car (ACD-123, 165 km/h, 32.3 l). Select speeds for both cars, make them
# drive for three hours and print out the values of their kilometer counters.
